# Research
I study migration in advanced industrial societies in order to understand how different policies, circumstances, and external shocks shape the outcomes of migration, from the integration of migrants into the host society’s economic, social, and political life, to the maintenance of the culture of origin, to the reactions of the native-born from acceptance to violence. My work applies causal inference and machine learning methods and uses large-scale administrative, survey, and media data. I completed my PhD in Politics at New York University and I hold a Bachelor's and a Master's in Economics from Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México.
